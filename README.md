#### Python Bindings [WIP]

This repo basically show case how to call C/C++ functions, classes in Python. A good reason why you may need this is probably because you want to take advantage of C/C++ speed and reliability.

I got to learn about some existing binders via <https://realpython.com/python-bindings-overview/>

The source code for the tutorial resides in `tuts` folder while my examples can be found in `playground` where I used played around with some of the binders
